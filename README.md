# scrumplesign

This is code for an LED sign I made for my friend's Burning Man camp.

The sign displays a pre-set series of patterns using my [Pattern Library](https://github.com/johnmyrda/pattern-library).

I used a hack adopted from [FastLED with RGBW NeoPixels (SK6812)](http://www.partsnotincluded.com/neopixels/fastled-rgbw-neopixels-sk6812/) since I needed to use RGBW Led strips with FastLED.

The code compiles with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), an embedded/IoT development environment that works well with Arduino.

See my post about the sign on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcaedF1lAFl/?taken-by=gglii).
